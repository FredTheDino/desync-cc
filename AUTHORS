The conceptualization and high-level design for the tool was done by Ulf Kargén.

Stage 1 - the predicate-insertion component that works on intermediate 
assembly files - was originally written by Ivar Härnqvist and Johannes Wilson.

Stage 2 - the junk-byte generator that works on the final binary - was
originally written by Gustav Eriksson and Evelina Holmgren.

Ulf Kargén has contributed with various bugfixes and feature additions to both
components.

The opaque predicates in config/predicates/diablo.txt originate from the LOCO
tool in the Diablo framework (https://diablo.elis.ugent.be/), Copyright (C)
